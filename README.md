This project aims to identify a specific web user, known as Alice, based on the browsing behavior on the Internet. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can predict whether a given webpage session belongs to Alice or to someone else. The dataset used in this project comes from the proxy servers at Blaise Pascal University (Kaggle competition).).
